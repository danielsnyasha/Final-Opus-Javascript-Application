# FinalAppOpus
 This is a fullstack application I developed using Javascript, it uses MySQL, Cloudinary and Firebase on the backend. There are various APIs which were used, and it was developed on the React.js framework which runs off Node.js and Javascript. Several things were included in the final deploy, but I cannot share them because of confidentiality issues with the company I developed it for. There is a seperate front-end and backend, and the reason I included it is because it shows a variety of skills in one application. Usually I add features like WebGIS, but it was not required in this project. It was meant to run on the local network, thus there wasn't any need to do an external deployment. Everything is working, the client was satisfied with the final model, and some of the images show my great depth in front-end development as I also did some awesome Graphic Designing there...
